# Change Log

All notable changes to the "petpet-language" extension will be documented in this file.
Version numbers of the extension correspond to the version of PetPet they were made for.

## [0.3.4]

- Initial release

## [0.3.400]

- Made identifiers with numbers in the name not appear as numbers, like `vec3(1, 5, 10)` no longer highlights the 3 as a number
- Distinguished . and : from other operators so now maybe people can change the color of them if they want? idk how that works lol

## [1.0.0]

- Finally stopped doing stupid things with the version number
- Made the `not`, `and`, `or`, `true`, `false`, and `null` keywords be highlighted properly
